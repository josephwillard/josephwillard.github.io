* Introduction
In this post I'll cover the basics of unifying and reifying expressions and there motivations for symbolic-pymc.

* Unify
The idea behind unify is to take two similar terms and form a *substitution* which can be thought of as a mapping between variables and values. Let's look at a few quick examples,

| Constant | Variable | Substitution |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| (4, 5)   | (x, 5)   | {x: 4}       |
| 'test'   | 'txst'   | {x: 'e'}     |
