** The disconect between python interface functions and the underlying graph objects
*** ex:
x_tf = tf.constant(1, name='x', dtype=tf.floart64)
look at,
x_op = x_tf.op
# Where's the valu7e/1, name and dtype in inputs?
list(x_op.inputs)
x_op.outputs
x_op.type
# leadas to there being more than an op (op_def is the real op, which is a pb2(proto buf object) serialized object)
# found missing value parameter (1) by
x_op.get_attr("value")
